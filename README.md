# COLD French Law Dataset Pipeline

CLI pipeline for generating and uploading the [COLD French Law dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/harvard-lil/cold-french-law).

The COLD French Law dataset is a collection of currently applicable law articles filtered from [France's LEGI dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/legi-codes-lois-et-reglements-consolides/). 

English translations are available for ~800K articles. These translations were generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 and provided by [Casetext, Part of Thomson Reuters](https://casetext.com/).

> ⚠️ This process is transformative and, while data is sourced from [France's LEGI dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/legi-codes-lois-et-reglements-consolides/):
> - The accuracy of the data going in and out of this pipeline cannot be guaranteed.  
> - This pipeline and resulting dataset are unofficial and experimental
